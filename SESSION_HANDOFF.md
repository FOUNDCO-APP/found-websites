# SESSION_HANDOFF.md - Found Co. Current Truth
### Start here after `BRIEF.md`. Keep this short, current, and plain-English.
*Last updated: July 7, 2026*

---

## Purpose

This is the shared handoff file for Codex, Claude Code, or any other AI working on Found.

Use this file to prevent lost context when Shawn switches tools, runs out of credits, or tests from his phone. This is not the full history. It is the current operational truth.

Current session history belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`.
Older detailed history belongs in `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
Active task backlog belongs in `TASKS.md`.
Locked decisions belong in `DECISIONS.md` and `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`.

History policy: keep the current working window and anything still active in current docs. Move older completed history to archive so AI can read the current truth quickly without losing the old record.

## Current Status

- Repo is on `main`.
- Latest known commit: `3be15cc` - `Rebuild estimate builder header as truly fixed, not sticky-in-scroll`.
- Worktree is clean and pushed.
- Shawn live-tested all 6 July 6 items on `my.foundco.app` on July 7. Results: Camera, Company Switching, Leads/Requests sheet, Schedule all confirmed working. Estimate Requests confirmed working but surfaced a new bug (builder header gap). Estimates/Payments confirmed working but flagged a serious one: after paying, the estimate still showed the full unpaid balance.
- Traced the payment issue: the client-side "mark as paid" call had no error handling - if it failed, the customer's card was still charged successfully but our own record never updated, and nothing told anyone it happened. Now retries 3x. **Not fully closed** - see "Still Needs Work," the Stripe Dashboard webhook config needs a human to verify since no AI in this session has Stripe Dashboard access.
- Builder gap took 3 attempts to actually fix. Attempt 1 (margin math) and attempt 2 (`viewport-fit=cover`, which turned out to already be set one layer down) both missed the real cause. Attempt 3: removed `position: sticky` entirely - it was likely desyncing from true viewport top during iOS momentum/bounce scroll. Header is now genuinely `position: fixed` with its real height measured via `ResizeObserver`, not guessed. This is a structurally different fix, not another parameter tweak - should actually be closed now, but treat it as unconfirmed until Shawn tests it live.

## Changed / Finished

- [x] Schedule now opens to `Calendar`, not the Hours editor.
- [x] Schedule has `Calendar`, `Bookings`, and `Hours` tabs.
- [x] Hours is now a readable weekly summary first, with editing made deliberate.
- [x] More page has grouped business-tool sections instead of a flat list.
- [x] Business plan accounts no longer repeat a redundant Included Business Tools sales list.
- [x] Dock and More now share icon language for Requests, Estimates, Schedule, and related tools.
- [x] Blue Luna / balloon decor uses `Estimate Requests` as intake and keeps `Estimates` as a separate tool.
- [x] `Estimate Requests` can hand off to `Create Estimate`.
- [x] Manual Estimate Request save now prompts: create an estimate now or not yet.
- [x] Incoming Estimate Request rows show `Create Estimate` directly on the row.
- [x] Lead temperature no longer silently defaults to Warm.
- [x] Add-lead form is a slide-up sheet instead of an inline card.
- [x] Company switching was parallelized for speed.
- [x] Company switch tap feedback now highlights/spins immediately.
- [x] Camera blocked-permission path now shows guidance instead of leaving the owner on a black screen.
- [x] Added `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` as the current source of truth for AI handoffs.
- [x] Cleaned `BRIEF.md` so every AI starts from the handoff and team approval rules.
- [x] Created `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md` so older detailed history is preserved outside the current changelog.
- [x] Added a `git status` check to `BRIEF.md` Step 1 to close the uncommitted-handoff gap.
- [x] Rebuilt the post-payment confirmation on the public estimate page: client's own logo/name, bigger branded success moment, actual payment breakdown (amount paid + balance due), permanent instead of a 2.2s animation that decayed into a bare "Thank you."
- [x] Team decision: kept `automatic_payment_methods` enabled (Cash App, Klarna, etc. stay available) - Found clients' own customers may need those payment rails, so choice wasn't restricted to card/bank only.
- [x] Estimate builder header gap - first attempt (margin math) turned out not to be the real fix; root cause was `viewport-fit=cover` missing app-wide, fixed at the root in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- [x] Payment confirmation reliability - `handlePay()` in `AcceptButton.tsx` now retries the "mark as paid" call 3x with backoff instead of firing once with a silently-swallowed error.
- [x] Removed the redundant "ESTIMATE" eyebrow above "New estimate" in the builder header - one clear title, not two lines saying the same thing.
- [x] Verified directly against Supabase: the "Construction" test company's `primary_color` really is `#1565C0` (blue) - the payment sheet's branding is correctly applying it. Not a bug, just a test company whose real brand color happens to resemble Stripe's own blue.

## Still Needs Work

- [x] **Stripe Connect webhook gap - CLOSED July 7.** Confirmed via screenshots: the only registered endpoint listened to "Your account" events, not Connected accounts. Shawn created a second event destination in the Stripe Dashboard (sandbox) scoped to Connected accounts, Snapshot payload style, including `payment_intent.succeeded`. `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` now tries both `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (platform) and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CONNECT` (new) when verifying signatures, since each Stripe endpoint signs independently. New secret added to Vercel (production + preview) via API and to `.env.local`. Pushed as `31d34c0`. **Still needs:** the same Connect-scoped destination created in Stripe's *live* mode before actual launch - everything done so far was in the sandbox. Also a stray `empowering-bliss-thin` destination (wrong payload style, unused) should get deleted from the Stripe Dashboard - cleanup only, not blocking.
- [ ] Live-test this session's fixes (builder gap actually gone, payment retry behavior, redundant header copy removed, and now the webhook fallback) on `my.foundco.app`.
- [ ] QA Schedule across quote-first, restaurant, and booking-first profiles.
- [ ] Confirm whether sticky Schedule tabs are worth continuing. Shawn said it is okay if freeze/sticky tabs do not happen.
- [ ] QA payable estimates end to end with Stripe-connected account:
  - Accept and Pay.
  - Accept now, pay later.
  - Receipt email.
  - Owner email.
  - Dashboard states: `Paid`, `Deposit paid`, `Accepted, unpaid`.
  - Public paid state.
- [ ] **Sandbox test list for July 8 (Shawn confirmed "the list is good, keep it for tomorrow" - July 7):**
  - Full onboarding -> activation, start to finish, on a brand-new business: pick a plan, enter a test card, land on the dashboard for the first time. Hasn't been walked through since the plan-selector redesign.
  - Plan upgrades/downgrades and add-on purchases - confirm each transition re-gates the right tools correctly.
  - The "Accept now, pay later" email path specifically (separate from the direct-pay path already tested) - different email, different dashboard state.
  - All items above this one in this list (builder gap, payment retry, confirmation screen, header copy, webhook fallback, Schedule QA).
- [ ] Keep AI estimate builder gated until manual estimate + payment flow passes live QA.
- [ ] Invoice-now / POS-lite planning is still important, but behind live QA and More / Manage IA cleanup.
- [x] **Found-operator tooling (beginning-stage scope) - BUILT July 7-8, not yet tested live.** New `/admin/businesses` page (same shared `admin_key` gate as `/admin/photos` and `/admin/emails`): lists every company, search by name/slug/email, a "View as" button per row, a comp toggle, and a per-business notes field. `getCompany()` now has an admin override - when the selected-company cookie AND a server-verified `admin_key` cookie are both present, it fetches that company without the normal ownership check. Comping a business also sets `subscription_status: "active"`, which is what actually unblocks their dashboard. Dashboard shows a persistent orange "Viewing as [Business] (Admin)" banner with an Exit button whenever this is genuinely active. Pushed as `abe48a1`. Growth-stage needs (role permissions, audit log, churn dashboard) intentionally not built - backlog only.
  - **Must test:** log into `/admin/businesses` (uses the same admin key as `/admin/photos`), search for a real business, tap "View as," confirm the dashboard loads as that business with the orange banner showing, tap Exit and confirm it returns to Shawn's own account. Test the comp toggle on a real inactive test account and confirm the activation banner disappears immediately.

- [x] **Comp-before-the-card-prompt (both options) - BUILT July 8, not yet tested live.** Superseded the "mark comp after onboarding" answer above with two real paths, pushed as `04aaa3a`:
  1. **Comp link - zero card screen, ever.** Start onboarding at `https://foundco.app/onboarding?comp=<your admin key>` (the same key you use to log into `/admin/photos`). The company gets created already active. The final Reveal screen shows "Go to dashboard" instead of "Launch my site" - the business never sees a payment screen at all. Best for a clean demo, but only works if Shawn remembers to use that link.
  2. **In-flow fallback - works no matter how onboarding started.** As long as Shawn's browser already has the admin cookie (from logging into `/admin/photos` or `/admin/businesses` earlier in that session), the real "Launch my site" activation screen shows an extra dashed-orange button - "Activate as comp (Found team)" - right next to the normal plan/payment flow. Tap that instead of entering a card.
  - **Must test:** try the comp link end to end on a throwaway test business, confirm no card screen ever shows. Separately, go through normal onboarding *without* the comp link while logged into `/admin/photos` in the same browser, confirm the "Activate as comp" button appears on the real activation screen and works.

2. Tap Add lead/request.
3. Confirm Hot/Warm/Cold has no default selection.
4. Confirm Save is disabled until a temperature is picked.
5. Confirm the form opens as a sheet and the empty state does not show through under it.

### 4. Estimate Requests
1. Open Blue Luna Events or another quote-first business.
2. Confirm the dock says `Requests` or `Estimate Requests` as intended for the current mobile label, not generic `Leads`.
3. Add a new Estimate Request manually.
4. Confirm the prompt appears: create an estimate now or not yet.
5. Choose Create Estimate and confirm the estimate builder opens with customer info prefilled.
6. On an existing Estimate Request row, confirm `Create Estimate` appears without opening the detail sheet.

### 5. Schedule
1. Open Blue Luna Events and tap Schedule.
2. Confirm it opens to Calendar first.
3. Tap Bookings and confirm the empty or booked state is clear.
4. Tap Hours and confirm it shows a readable weekly summary first.
5. Tap Edit and confirm day toggles, time fields, booking settings, and time off still work.
6. Save and refresh to confirm changes persist.

### 6. Estimates / Payments
1. Use a Stripe-connected business.
2. Create and send a new estimate.
3. Open the public estimate link on mobile.
4. Test Accept and Pay with Stripe test mode.
5. Confirm the customer sees a clean success state.
