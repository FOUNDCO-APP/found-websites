## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

**Found Co.** is a new entity Shawn is creating. Goal: App Store (Apple) + Google Play.

It is a mobile-first SaaS platform that gives any small business owner three things from one app:
1. **Auto-generated website** — answer onboarding questions, site is built automatically
2. **In-app photo/video capture** — organized by job, off the personal camera roll
3. **Social media prep** — flagged photos sized and ready to post

**The core promise:** Owner answers questions → professional website is generated → it looks like Apple built it. No tech skills. No designers. No drag-and-drop. Done in under 10 minutes.

## REPO STRUCTURE

**Local path:** `C:\Users\SuperShawn\Documents\GitHub\found-websites`
**GitHub:** `github.com/FOUNDCO-APP/found-websites`
**Hosting:** Vercel (switched from Netlify on May 29, 2026)

**How multi-tenancy works:**
- Every Found Co. client website is served from this ONE Next.js app
- `barriobuilders.foundco.app` → proxy rewrites to `/barriobuilders/*`
- Custom domain (`barriobuilders.com`) → proxy detects non-foundco.app hostname → looks up by `custom_domain` in Supabase
- Each company is a row in the `companies` table with a unique `slug`

## PHOTO POOL SYSTEM

**Architecture:** Curated JSON files in Supabase Storage `config` bucket.

**File path per industry:** `config/photo-pools/{industry}.json`

**Format:**
```json
{
  "industry": "home_services",
  "photos": [
    {
      "url": "https://images.pexels.com/...",
      "desc": "Team-written description for alt text and SEO",
      "tag": "painting",
      "keywords": ["painting", "renovation", "interior", "contractor", "professional"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**`tag` values:** `null` = general (any business in category) · or specific sub-type e.g. `wedding`, `barber`, `food truck`, `yoga studio`

**Priority chain in `stockImages.ts`:**
1. Client's own real photos (Phase 3)
2. Cached `stock_images` on `website_config`
3. **Industry photo pool from Storage** ← curated by Shawn + team
4. Pexels API fallback
5. Gradient fallback

**Photo pools curated:** 11 original industries curated — home_services, food, wellness, events, retail, fitness, beauty, automotive, pet_services, cleaning, landscaping. Real Estate was added afterward as the 12th industry and can use Pexels fallback until its curated pool is approved.

**Admin curation page:** `foundco.app/admin/photos` (key: ask Shawn)

- `leads` — estimate/contact form submissions from client websites
- `contacts` — planned lightweight customer memory layer for leads, current clients, and previous clients
- `contact_consents` / `message_sequences` / `messages` — planned relationship automation upgrade tables for compliant email/text follow-up
- `estimates` / `invoices` / `payments` — planned upgrade tables for quotes, deposits, final payments, and receipts

## CURRENT PHASE — Phase 4: Customer Dashboard

Phase 2 (Onboarding Flow) and Phase 3 are substantially complete — all 4 layouts ship, onboarding generates real sites end-to-end, billing/activation works. See `TASKS.md` for the live NOW/BACKLOG list and `CHANGELOG.md` for full session-by-session history; this section is a snapshot, those two files are the source of truth.

**What's built and working (customer dashboard, `/dashboard`):**
- Auth: magic link + password login, company select for multi-business owners, PWA install support
- Home, Leads, Contacts, Site editor, Photos, More tabs — all functional
- Billing/activation: Stripe SetupIntent flow, in-dashboard activation banner (white bar/green button, opens the same `ActivateOverlay` used on public client sites — no separate navigation)
- Leads & Contacts: full Apple-Contacts-style detail sheets with edit capability (added June 18, 2026 — previously no way to edit an existing lead or contact at all)
- Shared `rem`-based typography system at `src/lib/dashboard/typography.ts` — applied to Leads, Contacts, Home, bottom tab bar; NOT yet applied to Site editor, More, Photos (next task)
- Identity-based avatar colors (Apple Contacts style) across Leads/Contacts

**Known gap:** Leads never convert to a separate customer entity — by design (see `DECISIONS.md`, June 18, 2026). Temperature (hot/warm/cold) is the permanent mechanism for tracking lead status.

**Current onboarding implementation note:** `/onboarding` saves `companies` and `website_config`, consumes the approved industry manifests and Q2.5 sub-industry, and generates homepage/service copy through Claude API when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set. If Claude is unavailable, Found saves deterministic fallback copy so the owner can still launch.

**Current Found homepage note:** `/` establishes the approved Found identity: Pure Studio with a Signal Green heartbeat, a refined `FOUND` wordmark, a cinematic device-stage hero, and a direct CTA into onboarding.
